![Three JavaScript Object-Oriented](https://github.com/iagokrt/three-javascript-object-oriented/blob/main/preview.png)

Welcome to the Three JavaScript Object-Oriented repository! This project focuses on implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and techniques in JavaScript using the powerful Three.js library. The aim of this project is to showcase how OOP concepts can be applied to create interactive and visually appealing 3D graphics and animations.
